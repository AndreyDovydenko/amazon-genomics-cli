## Download and install Amazon Genomics CLI

Download the Amazon Genomics CLI zip, unzip its contents, and run the `install.sh` script:

```
aws s3 cp s3://healthai-public-assets-us-east-1/amazon-genomics-cli/0.9.0/amazon-genomics-cli.zip .
unzip amazon-genomics-cli.zip -d agc
./agc/install.sh
```

This will place the `agc` command in `~/bin` and attempt to add the command to your `$PATH`
